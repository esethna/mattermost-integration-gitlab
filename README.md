# GitLab Integration Service for Mattermost

This integrations service posts [issue](http://doc.gitlab.com/ee/web_hooks/web_hooks.html#issues-events), [comment](http://doc.gitlab.com/ee/web_hooks/web_hooks.html#comment-events) and [merge request](http://doc.gitlab.com/ee/web_hooks/web_hooks.html#merge-request-events) events from a GitLab repository into specific Mattermost channels by formatting output from [GitLab's outgoing webhooks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/web_hooks/web_hooks.md) to [Mattermost's incoming webhooks](https://github.com/mattermost/platform/blob/master/doc/integrations/webhooks/Incoming-Webhooks.md).

Mattermost community members are invited to fork this repo to create new integrations. To have your integration referenced on http://www.mattermost.org/webhooks/, please mail info@mattermost.com or tweet to [@MattermostHQ](https://twitter.com/mattermosthq). 

## Requirements

To run this integration you need:

1. A **web server** supporting Python 2.7 or a compatible version to run this software (optionally, you could use a service provider like [Heroku](http://heroku.com) - see instructions below)
2. A **[GitLab account](https://about.gitlab.com/)** with a repository to which you have administrator access
3. A **[Mattermost account](http://www.mattermost.org/)** [where incoming webhooks are enabled](https://github.com/mattermost/platform/blob/master/doc/integrations/webhooks/Incoming-Webhooks.md#enabling-incoming-webhooks)

Regarding 1. there are many options for web servers you can use, below we provide instructions for both [**Heroku**](README.md#heroku-based-install) and a general [**Linux/Ubuntu**](README.md#linuxubuntu-1404-web-server-install) server to get something running:

### Heroku-based Install

To install this project using Heroku, you will need: 

1. A **Heroku account**, available for free from [Heroku.com](http://heroku.com)
2. A **GitHub account**, available for free from [GitHub.com](http://github.com) 

Here's how to start:

1. **Create a copy of this project to manipulate**
  1. From the [Github repository of this project](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-integration-gitlab/edit/it-edits/README.md) click **Fork** in the top-right corner to create a copy of this project that you control and can update as you like.
2. **Deploy your project copy to Heroku**
  1. Go to your [**Heroku Dashboard**](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) and click **+** in the top-right corner then **New App**. Give your app a unqiue name (like `mattermost-[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]`), select your region and click **Create App**.
  2. On the **Deploy** screen, select **GitHub** at the top, then click **Connect to GitHub** to authorize Herkou to access your GitHub account.
  3. Select your account and search for your repo name, for example `mattermost-[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]`, in the **repo-name** field, then click **Search** then the **Connect** button next to your repository.
  4. Scroll to the bottom of the new page and under the **Manual Deploy** section click **Deploy Branch**, making sure the `master` branch is selected.
  5. Go to **Settings** > **Domains** > **Settings** and copy the URL below **Heroku Domain** (we'll refer to this as `http://<your-heroku-domain>/` and we'll need it in the next step)
  6. Leave your Heroku interface open as we'll come back to it to finish the setup.

3. **Connect your project to your GitLab account for outgoing webhooks**
 1. Log in to GitLab account and to the project from which you want to receive updates and to which you have administrator access. From the left side of the project screen, click on **Settings** > **Web Hooks** and in the **URL** field enter `http://<your-heroku-domain>/` from the previous step, plus the word `new_event` to create an entry that reads **`http://<your-heroku-domain>/new_event`** so events from your GitLab project are sent to your Heroku server.
 2. From the same page, under **Trigger** select **Push events**, **Comment events**, **Issue events**, **Merge Request events**
 3. (Recommended but optional): Encrypt your connection from GitLab to your project by selecting **Enable SSL verification**. If this option is not available and you're not familiar with how to set it up, contact your GitLab System Administrator for help.
 3. Click **Add Web Hook** to check that a new entry about your webhook is added to the **Web hooks** section below the button.
 4. Leave this page open as we'll come back to it to test that everything is working.
 
4. **Connect your project to your Mattermost account for incoming webhooks**
 1. Log in to your Mattermost account, and from three dot icon at the top of the left-hand menu go to **Account Settings** > **Integrations** > **Incoming Webhooks** > **Edit**.
 2. Under **Add a new incoming webhook** select the channel in which you want GitLab notifications to appear, then click **Add**, which should create a new entry below.
 3. From the new entry below, copy the contents next to **URL** (we'll refer to this as `https://<your-mattermost-webhook-URL>` and add it to your Heroku server).
 4. Go to your Heroku app page and to **Settings** > **Config Variables** > **Reveal Config Vars**
     1. Add **MATTERMOST_WEBHOOK_URL** in the **KEY** field and paste `https://<your-mattermost-webhook-URL>` into **VALUE** and click **Add**
     2. In the second **KEY** field add **PUSH_TRIGGER** and in the corresponding **VALUE** field add **True**.
5. **Test that everything is working**
  1. If your GitLab project is in active development, return to the webhooks page of your GitLab project and click **Test Hook** to send a test message about one of your recent updates from your GitLab project to Mattermost
  2. If your GitLab project is not active, if it's brand new for example, try creating an issue as a test, and check that the new issues is posted to Mattermost
  3. Back on the settings page of your Heroku app, under the **Config Variables**, click **Reveal Config Vars** and then click the `X` next to the **PUSH_TRIGGER** field you added. This was used for testing only, and is better left turned off for production
  4. If you have any issues, it's probably our fault for not well documenting the setup. So please go to http://forum.mattermost.org and let us know that our instructions didn't work, and let us know which steps were the most unclear.


### Linux/Ubuntu 14.04 Web Server Install

The following procedure shows how to install this project on a Linux web server running Ubuntu 14.04. The following instructions work behind a firewall so long as the web server has access to your GitLab and Mattermost instances. 

To install this project using a Linux-based web server, you will need:

1. A Linux/Ubuntu 14.04 web server supporting Python 2.7 or a compatible version. Other compatible operating systems and Python versions should also work. 

Here's how to start:

1. **Set up your Mattermost instance to receive incoming webhooks**
 1. Log in to your Mattermost account, and from three dot icon at the top of the left-hand menu go to **Account Settings** > **Integrations** > **Incoming Webhooks** > **Edit**.
 2. Under **Add a new incoming webhook** select the channel in which you want GitLab notifications to appear, then click **Add**, which should create a new entry below.
 3. From the new entry below, copy the contents next to **URL** (we'll refer to this as `https://<your-mattermost-webhook-URL>` and add it to your Heroku server).
